# Fullscreen/Immersive Gesture Tweaks for Android 10-13

THIS REPO HAS BEEN MOSTLY DISCONTINUED AS OF MAGISK'S DISABLING OF THE REPO FEATURE, TO ALWAYS DOWNLOAD MY UPDATED MODULE USE [FOX MODULE MANAGER](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager/releases) AS MY MODULE IS NOW BEING DEVELOPED ON THE [ALT-REPO](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/HideNavBar)

This Magisk Module lets you tweak Android 10-13's gestures.

## Requirements
- Android 10-13
- Magisk 20+

## Installation 
1. Flash the module
2. Select the desired options on the volume selector
3. Reboot
4. Enjoy!

## Terminal Setup
 Run on a terminal app the following command 
 su -c hn

## Disclaimer
- Any option not working is due to incompatibility with your current ROM (there's little i can do about it)
- GSI compabitility isn't guaranteed due to Magisk's inconsistent GSI support
- For issues related to GCam after installing the module you may use the terminal setup tool to increase the navbar size slightly to workaround the issue
- Automatic navbar coloring doesn't work on Android 11+

- Additionally back gestures can be disabled on Android 11-12 for either left side only (to access side menus on apps) or both sides (if one wishes to remap the back gestures with other apps)

### Translation
