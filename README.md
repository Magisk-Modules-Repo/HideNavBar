![](https://i.imgur.com/vcXAreJ.png)

## DUE TO THE MAGISK REPOSITORY SHUTING DOWN IF YOU WISH TO GET UPDATES FOR MY MODULE YOU'LL NEED TO USE THE FOLLOWING [APP](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager/releases) AND MAKE SURE TO ENABLE EITHER THE ANDROIDACY OR ALT REPO

This Magisk Module lets you tweak Android 10-12's gestures.

## Requirements
- Android 10-12
- Magisk 20+

## Installation 
1. Flash the module
2. Select the desired options on the volume selector
3. Reboot
4. Enjoy!

### Translation
 If you wish to have the installer translated to your language send me a text file containing all lines (inside ui_print in common/install.sh) either on Github or my Email

## Disclaimer
- Any option not working is due to incompatibility with your current ROM (there's little i can do about it)
- Any issues related to GCam after installing the module are outside my control 
- Automatic navbar coloring doesn't work on Android 11+

## Changelog
### v10.0
- Added Support for Android 12L, and thank you all very much for your support over these 2 years of development
### v9.9
- Allow hiding the buttons underneath the keyboard in Immersive mode
### v9.8

### v9.5

### v9.3-hotfix

### v8.5
- Revert to old install logic on Android 11 (attempts to bug fix module not installing correctly on some devices)
