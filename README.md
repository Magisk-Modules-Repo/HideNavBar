2. Select the desired options on the volume selector
3. Reboot
4. Enjoy!

 su -c hn

### Translation
 If you wish to have the installer translated to your language send me a text file containing all lines (inside ui_print in common/install.sh) either on Github or my Email

## Disclaimer
- Any option not working is due to incompatibility with your current ROM (there's little i can do about it)

- Automatic navbar coloring doesn't work on Android 11+
